#### 🗄️ Database Model Diagram

Create a Datamodel with DBdiagram.io and add it to your repository - Use https://dbdiagram.io/

- [How to make changes on the diagram](/diagram.md)


## 📈 Process 📉📈

You must clone this project and check the open issues, wireframes and build the datamodel.

### 💻 Working with code

- ALWAYS run code before a PR is made.
- No committing `console.log`
- No committing merge conflicts!
- Work in separate files! When you make a new feature, the first thing you do is create a new file for that (of course if it makes sense). Especially for components. 

### 👍🏽 Code best practices
Follow these best practices for coding: [HERE](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/curriculum/blob/master/review/review-checklist.md)

This can be used as a checklist for every PR you make. Go through the list and see if you have used all the best practices

###  <img width=25px height=25x src="/swagger-logo.png"  alt="Swagger logo"></a> Working with API Documentation - Swagger

When running the API, you will automatically be running the API Documentation
which is based on Swagger. Just go to
[localhost:3000/api/documentation](http://localhost:3000/api/documentation) to
read the specifications for the API.

You can use your api token to authorize in Swagger and you will be able to
perform test calls against the API directly from Swagger.

If you need to make changes to the specification, this can be done via the
[Swagger.json](/src/server/config/swagger.json) file.

### <img width=20px height=20x src="/storybook.svg"  alt="Storybook logo"></a> Working with Storybook 
Tool for developing UI components in isolation 

Check here https://storybook.js.org/

### <img width=30px height=30x src="/aws.svg"  alt="AWS S3 logo"></a><img width=30px height=30x src="/s3.png"  alt="AWS S3 logo"></a> Working with AWS - Amazon Services
AWS is used for uploading files on a AWS S3 bucket. There is a user on the AWS that has `AmazonS3FullAccess`. There is not a AWS root key, but ONLY a key and a secret key for the AWS user. 

If you need the key and secret to put into the .env file, write to the project manager of the project. 

REMEMBER, this key should be kept super secret!!! NEVER add this to any PR!!

### Testing

To make a new test, add a `COMPONENT_NAME.test.js` to a component. See fx the `Home` component to get an example of a simple test.

To run all test, write this command:

`npm run test`

To run the tests when you change a test file, run:

`npm run test:watch`

## 🏁 Getting Started
First fork the repo to your own github and then clone it into your local machine using a terminal or a git client.

#### 💾 [Installations](/installations.md)

##### Errors
If you get this error: `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, scandir`

Then try and run this script: `npm rebuild node-sass`

#### Code linting

To ensure we all code the same way, we are using linting in this project! We use prettier to do the linting for us. To Use the linting in this project, set your code editor up with the `.prettierrc.js` files. 

In Visual Studio code, go to file -> Preferences -> settings -> Search for `prettier: config path` -> In the input write `.prettierrc.js`
